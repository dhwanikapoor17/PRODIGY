EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
Univariate Analysis
Univariate analysis is a data analysis technique that focuses on examining and describing the characteristics and distribution of a single variable in a dataset. In this project, I performed univariate analysis on various variables in the Titanic dataset, including:

Histograms for age distribution.
Bar plots for passenger class distribution.
Pie chart for survival rate.
Bivariate Analysis
Bivariate analysis explores relationships between two variables in the dataset. In this project,I investigate relationships such as:

Scatter plots for age vs. fare.
Bar plots comparing the number of survivors by passenger class.
Box plots comparing fares by passenger class.
Correlation heatmap between age and fare
Multivariate Analysis
Multivariate analysis extends the exploration to multiple variables simultaneously.I used techniques like parallel coordinates plots to visualize relationships between multiple variables and survival.
